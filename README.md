# 🦀 Rust Learning Grind

Welcome to my Rust journey — a focused learning path to master Rust for Web3, Solana, and systems-level programming.

## 🚀 Why I'm Learning Rust

- To build performant and safe smart contracts on **Solana**
- To deepen my understanding of **memory safety, ownership, and lifetimes**
- To contribute to open-source projects in **Web3 and decentralized AI**

i highly recommend this as the starting point before going for the documenations tutorials --this helped me haha

## 📅 Start Date: June 21, 2025

## 📚 Week 1: Core Rust Foundations

### ✅ Day 1: Setup + First Program
- [x] Installed Rust via `rustup`
- [x] Set up VS Code + WSL2
- [x] Created and ran first program with `cargo`
- [x] Wrote basic `assert_eq!` tests

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2 + 2;
    assert_eq!(x, 4);
    println!("All good, x = {}", x);
}

### ✅ Day 2,day 3,day 4: 

## ✅ Topics Covered
✅ Day 2–4: Variables, Functions, Ownership, Logic
Practiced mutability vs shadowing

Mastered fn, return values, and expressions

Covered borrowing & references

Worked through boolean logic and CLI interaction


- ✅ Variables (mutable, shadowing)
- ✅ Functions and return values
- ✅ Ownership, borrowing
- ✅ Boolean logic
- ✅ Control flow (`if`, `match`)
- ✅ Loops (`while`, `for`)
- ✅ Strings and slices
- ✅ Type casting, expressions
- ✅ CLI project: Guessing Game

---

## 💡 Notes

- This project is built and tested using `cargo check` and `cargo run`.
- Each subfolder has its own `main.rs` entry with working code.

---

## 🔗 To Do

- [ ] Add `pattern_matching/` practice
- [ ] Add Solana-style low-level data modeling
- [ ] Expand guessing game with retries and scoring

## ✅ Topics Covered So Far
✅ Variables (immutable, mutable, shadowing)

✅ Functions & return values

✅ Ownership, borrowing, references

✅ Boolean logic & operators

✅ Control flow: if, match

✅ Loops: loop, while, for

✅ Strings and slices

✅ Type casting, expressions

✅ CLI project: Guessing Game

## 🛠️ How to Run
## Each subfolder has a working main.rs file for that concept.
''' 
cargo check       # fast syntax check
cargo run         # run current main.rs

## ✨ Mindset
“You don’t rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”
