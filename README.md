# ðŸ¦€ Rust Learning Grind

Welcome to my Rust journey â€” a focused learning path to master Rust for Web3, Solana, and systems-level programming.

## ðŸš€ Why I'm Learning Rust

- To build performant and safe smart contracts on **Solana**
- To deepen my understanding of **memory safety, ownership, and lifetimes**
- To contribute to open-source projects in **Web3 and decentralized AI**

## ðŸ“š Week 1: Core Rust Foundations

### âœ… Day 1: Setup + First Program
- [x] Installed Rust via `rustup`
- [x] Set up VS Code + WSL2
- [x] Created and ran first program with `cargo`
- [x] Wrote basic `assert_eq!` tests

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2 + 2;
    assert_eq!(x, 4);
    println!("All good, x = {}", x);
}
