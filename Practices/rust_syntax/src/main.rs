// Rust has the advantages of memory safety,
//  high performance, concurrency safety, rich ecosystem, and cross-platform support.
// It is suitable for developing system-level software with
// high performance, high reliability, and concurrency safety
// this is the rust sysntax
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

// fn main()	Defines the entry point of every Rust binary program. fn means "function".

// { ... }	Curly braces define the body of the function. Required in Rust (no optional indentation).
// then the actual body of the program goes to the next line with the logic going there
// println!()	This is a macro (notice the !) used to print to the console next line
